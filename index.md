## Hello website
Welcome to the CS-E4101 Introduction to DevOps course! Or rather, my exercises for the course... 

### About ME...
I am a person contemplating a career shift due to bad luck (or choices) during earlier years. It would be nice to find one’s place in the corner, drinking coffee and coding at one’s own pace without fear of meeting clients or talking to overly eager co-workers. I find it unfortunate that software development is being advertised as a suitable career choice also for extroverts. It is supposed to be the perfect option for introverts!
I am still willing to develop my skill set, in whichever direction needed, although I find it distressing that the skills and experience I already possess are not valued because they are a few years old. 

More on my thoughts about the course in [THE DIARY](diary-050.md)
