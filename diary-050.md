### Why did I take this course?
As a life scientist without a position that pays, nor little hope of finding one, I took to the internet to look for other options. Everywhere it screams about the shortage of competent IT-professionals and how the need for them keeps growing. I thought, “Hey, that might be interesting!”. So here I am. This is not the only course in computer science I am taking. I have no idea of what software development entails besides coding. The other courses are programming courses but this is one handles one view of the bigger picture and practicalities of software development. 

Due to the restrictions imposed on me by authorities, I had to calculate very carefully how many credits I am allowed to do and based on that, which courses I want to take in the hope of benefiting the most in terms of future prospects. One of the deciding factors here was the online delivery of the course: it would have been too expensive to travel to lectures or practical sessions. Another extremely important quality of the course is that it doesn’t include an exam. And of course, it is free!

My expectations for this particular course were mostly about getting to know the lingo a little, but also to get an idea what this DevOps means, since it is often mentioned in job postings. I did, however, expect a bit more hands-on exercises and practical stuff, regardless of the limited extent of the course, and less of reflective writing. Maybe I was expecting contents of a course worth 2 ECTS credit with a mini project executed DevOps- style in a group would have introduced the culture in practice. 


### So what have I learned?
Still learning... to put things in an unordered list?
