### Why did I take this course?
As a life scientist without a position that pays, nor little hope of finding one, I took to the internet to look for other options. Everywhere it screams about the shortage of competent IT-professionals and how the need for them keeps growing. I thought, “Hey, that might be interesting!”. So here I am. This is not the only course in computer science I am taking. I have no idea of what software development entails besides coding. The other courses are programming courses but this is one handles one view of the bigger picture and practicalities of software development. 

Due to the restrictions imposed on me by authorities, I had to calculate very carefully how many credits I am allowed to do and based on that, which courses I want to take in the hope of benefiting the most in terms of future prospects. One of the deciding factors here was the online delivery of the course: it would have been too expensive to travel to lectures or practical sessions. Another extremely important quality of the course is that it doesn’t include an exam. And of course, it is free!

My expectations for this particular course were mostly about getting to know the lingo a little, but also to get an idea what this DevOps means, since it is often mentioned in job postings. I did, however, expect a bit more hands-on exercises and practical stuff, regardless of the limited extent of the course, and less of reflective writing. Maybe I was expecting contents of a course worth 2 ECTS credit with a mini project executed DevOps- style in a group would have introduced the culture in practice. 


### So what have I learned?
What I think I have learnt so far:
  * DevOps is a culture of development
  * Culture cannot be copied directly
  * With a good culture, software developers are more satisfied at work
  * Automation is your friend
    * cost-effective
    * no more human errors
    * consistency
    * enables faster delivery
    * easier maintainability
  * DevOps helps get functional software to the consumers faster
    * The first version of the software works well enough 	
    * Later versions are further improvements of earlier versions
    * Further testing during use, feedback from customers
    * Customers are more satisfied when small incremental changes improve the product without causing disruptions in service 

Not having anyone to discuss things with or show me what to do made this a little bit more challenging than I had thought. Trying out everything by myself lead to a lot of trial and error moments and I have doubts whether I could do the exact same thing again without making the same mistakes all over again. Also, since I don’t know when I will use GitHub again, I don’t think I will remember anything I have done there.

The Markdown tutorial was easy to do and easy to go back to when the exact number of underscores or asterisks escaped my mind. I also had to double check the different kinds of brackets and what is supposed to go in them when making links. I’m not sure whether I linked the image the way I was supposed to, though. Free images have to be downloaded instead of just linking to the URL (which makes sense, when you think about it). Since there weren’t specific instructions about to where to store the downloaded image and how to link to it, I searched for a “recipe” and used some trick that is supposedly not in the books. Hope it still works. It does show the image on my intro page, at least.
