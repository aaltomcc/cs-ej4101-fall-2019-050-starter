### Why did I take this course?
As a life scientist without a position that pays, nor little hope of finding one, I took to the internet to look for other options. Everywhere it screams about the shortage of competent IT-professionals and how the need for them keeps growing. I thought, “Hey, that might be interesting!”. So here I am. And this is not the only course in computer science (well, programming) I am taking. 

Due to the restrictions imposed on me by authorities, I had to calculate very carefully how many credits I can do. One of the deciding factors here was the online delivery of the course: it would have been too expensive to travel to lectures or practical sessions. Another important quality of the course was that there is no exam.

My expectations for this particular course were about getting to know the lingo a little, and to get an idea what this DevOps means, since it is often mentioned in job postings. I did, however, expect a bit more hands-on exercises and practical stuff, regardless of the limited extent of the course.  


### So what have I learned?
Still learning... to put things in an unordered list?
